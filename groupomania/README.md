# OP-PROJECT7 Front End#

This is the front end server for Project 7 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have `Node` and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the `groupomania` folder of the project, run `npm install`.
Run `vue ui`, select menu `Tasks` - `serve` at the webpage opened. 
Click `run task` to generate the app, then click `open app` to run the serve.

The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
